# Hako EPub Extension

This browser extension allows you to download EPub from https://hako.vn https://docln.net https://docln.sbs and https://sonako.fandom.com websites
The EPub file is the standard you can import it into Calibre and transfer it to your Kindle for reading. I have a Kindle PaperWhite 3 so I developed this extension. I also have 1 plugin for KOReader that allows me to read manga online directly on my Kindle without a computer on my GitHub  🍃
