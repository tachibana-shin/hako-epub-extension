# Hako EPub Extension

This browser extension allows you to download EPub from websites
The EPub file is the standard you can import it into Calibre and transfer it to your Kindle for reading. I have a Kindle PaperWhite 3 so I developed this extension. I also have 1 plugin for KOReader that allows me to read manga online directly on my Kindle without a computer on my GitHub  🍃
